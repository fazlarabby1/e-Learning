*****************
Framework ana libraries used in this project are:
# react-bootstrap, bootstrap, react-hot-toast, react-icons, react router, firebase authentication system, swiper js, and cdbreact for converting react to pdf.

*****************
This project is based on Computer Science and Engineering. I have collected 6 CSE related courses information and created a fake DB server. Each course has a course title, image, id, description, total student number, and ratings.

*****************
There are total 6 options in the header. Each of them contains some information.

*****************
There are total 3 login systems. These are Email and Password, Google, and GitHub. After login the user's photo will be visible in the header and by clicking that photo one can check their profile.

*****************
In the courses page, all the courses name are visible on the left side, and the courses summary are shown in cards. Clicking the course details button of the summary card will take the user to a dynamic route which contains the whole information of the course.

*****************
There is a Get Premium access button in the course details card. One must login to this site to visit this link.

Hope, I will develop this site further more. Keep me in your prayers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
